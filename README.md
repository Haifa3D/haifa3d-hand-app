# Haifa 3D

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/georg-jung/Haifa3d/_apis/build/status/georg-jung.technion-robotic-arm?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/georg-jung/Haifa3d/_build/latest?definitionId=12&branchName=master)

This repository tracks the development of an Android app that enables users of Haifa 3D's artificial hands to control and configure their prosthesis. To achieve that the application connects to the hand's controller via Bluetooth Low Energy.

The scope of this project begins with the defintion of the BTLE based protocol and includes the deployment of a fully functional Android application to the Play Store that is usable by the end users.

See the [programmer's manual](/doc/programmers-manual.md) for an introduction to the project from a technical & code point of view.
